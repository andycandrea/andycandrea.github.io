Hi!

My name is Andy Andrea, and I'm a Midwesterner by birth, a North Carolinian by
choice and a software developer by trade. In addition to writing code, I really
like to think about how I can do things a little better each day. At work,
that translated into my role as the Director of Software Development at SciMed
Solutions in downtown Durham, North Carolina where I get to write code for a
wide variety of interesting projects while working every day to make our
internal processes better than the day before; that way, we can give our clients
what they need right when they need it without cutting any technical corners.

I graduated from the University of North Carolina in 2014 with degrees in
computer science and astrophysics. While I don't get to utilize my physics
education quite as regularly as my CS education, it still remains a great
interest of mine.

If you're using lines of code as a metric, most of my professional experience is
in Ruby, but, as a full-stack developer, I've written my fair share of
JavaScript as well and have been responsible for creating and updating the UI
and UX of each project that I've worked on. I've also maintained several Python
projects and am always interested in learning a new language or framework.
