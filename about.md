Hi!

My name is Andy Andrea, and I'm a Midwesterner by birth, a North Carolinian by
choice and a web developer by trade. Currently, I do Ruby on Rails development
alongside the wonderfully talented team at [SciMed
Solutions](http://scimedsolutions.com) in downtown Durham, North Carolina.

I graduated from the University of North Carolina in 2014 with degrees in
computer science and astrophysics. While I don't get to utilize my physics
education quite as regularly as my CS education, it remains a great interest of
mine; in fact, I'm currently working on [a side project to utilize
both](https://github.com/andycandrea/polaris).

While the majority of my background is in back-end Rails development, I'm also
interested in front-end work. I've also briefly dabbled in Node.js and
intend to start tinkering with functional programming via Elixir and Phoenix.

Offline, I spend my time collecting vinyl records, reading some good books,
cooking--and eating!--a variety of cuisines and travelling when I can.
