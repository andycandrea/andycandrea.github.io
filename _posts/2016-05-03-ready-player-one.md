From its opening chapters, *Ready Player One* promises a lot; if I were to
attempt to categorize it, I'd say that it's a somewhat dystopian adventure novel
(somehow managing to have an almost utopian element) that provides social
commentary via a fun underdog story chock-full of camaraderie and references to
1980s pop culture.

Also, a large portion of it is set in a video game.

If that's a little much to follow without context, here's a quick overview (no
spoilers beyond what's covered in the summary on the back cover): *Ready Player
One* follows the story of Wade Watts, our eighteen-year-old protagonist and
narrator in the year 2045.[^1] In Cline's portrayal, the real world of the
future is a less than ideal place: catastrophic climate change, rampant wealth
inequality and dangerous living conditions are several aspects of reality that
influence Wade to spend as much time away from the physical world as possible.
Luckily for him, the denizens of the future have an escape from the real world
that doesn't (yet?) exist in 2016: the OASIS.

Described as part
[MMORPG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Massively_multiplayer_online_role-playing_game)
and part virtual society, the OASIS is a digital universe comprised of thousands
of different worlds and accessed via a virtual reality rig comprised of a
headset and haptic gloves—think of the entire thing as a futuristic fusion of
an [Oculus Rift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oculus_Rift) with [Second
Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Life) and, well, the entirety of the
Internet.

When he's plugged into the OASIS, Wade gets to leave his overweight and
poverty-stricken physical self behind and take control of his personal avatar,
Parzival: his under-leveled and poverty-stricken digital self that rarely has
the resources required to leave his school.

Fortunately for Wade, there's something other than school in the OASIS to entice
him: Halliday's Easter egg. Just like those found in many games, movies and
websites that exist in 2016—see
[here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Google_easter_eggs) for just a few
examples—this Easter egg is a hidden element that can only be accessed by
fulfilling a set of less than obvious criteria. In this case, the first person
that's able to find the egg will be awarded the vast fortune of the OASIS's
creator, James Halliday, and untold power over the future of the OASIS.

In a world where the OASIS is an even bigger cultural phenomenon than the modern
Internet, the stakes couldn't be higher, and the competition couldn't be more
fierce. Unfortunately, anyone who hopes to have a chance of winning the prize
will have to unravel the meaning behind the cryptic clues left behind by
Halliday; due to Halliday's eccentric nature and obsession with the 1980s, this
will require a vast knowledge of relatively obscure pop culture from decades
past.

## The Good :smiley:

Few works of fiction have captivated me quite as quickly as *Ready Player One*.
The writing is easy to follow but not jejune, and Cline does a great job of
pacing himself while providing background to his world; I never felt like I was
bogged down by historical minutiae nor did I ever feel that I lacked context.

Cline also did a fantastic job of providing variety within the book's setting.
At first, I worried that the continual '80s references would get tiresome
quickly, as I can't claim to be particularly knowledgeable about the pop culture
of the decade prior to my birth. In practice, though, many references were
either well-explained (the setting of
[Zork](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork)) or extremely well-known (how to play
Pacman). Cline also did a great job of throwing in references to elements more
modern geek culture, like *Firefly*, *World of Warcraft* or [Wil
Wheaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wil_Wheaton).[^2] Further, he managed to
take his references from varying media including video games, movies and
television, which helped to prevent anything from feeling stale.

Due to Wade's independent nature and the book's first-person perspective, I felt
that I didn't get to spend much time with the supporting characters. Somehow,
though, each of the other main characters—or my perspectives of them, at
least—managed to grow as the book progressed. I will admit that I was somewhat
surprised by Cline's decision to transform Wade from physically overweight to
physically fit. It seemed at first to make him somewhat more generic as a
protagonist, though I soon learned that his physical transformation served a
specific purpose later in the story.

## The Neutral :neutral_face:

Okay, the
[Serenity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serenity_%28Firefly_vessel%29) is
great, but Wade's in-game ship could've been [so much
cooler](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Normandy_SR-2).

## The Bad :frowning:

While the more fun and fantastic elements of Cline's universe were just that,
the less happy elements of the story felt quite underdeveloped. While it's very
clear that the condition of the world in which Wade lives is extremely poor from
the first few chapters, I felt like much of these details became irrelevant and
forgotten as the story progressed, serving only to provide explanation for the
existence of the story's antagonistic evil corporation, IOI.

Speaking of which, the book's "big bad" was a very generic blemish on a work
that was otherwise largely fun and creative. From their motivation that can
basically be summed up as "We want money and power so that we can be rich and
powerful!" to the fact that it's made perfectly clear that *literally everyone
in the world knows that IOI is entirely and irredeemably evil*, they're almost
impossible to take seriously. Even though they have the evil resources within
the scope of the book's universe to be entirely successful in their evil
endeavors, it's utterly unbelievable that such a one-dimensional (and evil—did
I mention they're evil yet?) villain could have any modicum of success within a
popular work of fiction.

I will say, though, that I've yet to read *Lacero*,[^3] which provides some
additional backstory to the primary antagonist of *Ready Player One* and is now
published within newer editions of the book. It's quite possible that this would
provide me with additional context that would lessen these negative opinions.

## The Verdict :video_game:

Overall, *Ready Player One* is a fantasically fun work of fiction. Cline does a
remarkable job of blending the familiar (to me, at least) world of geeky pop
culture with a brand new world of his own creation. Excluding his almost
comedically undeveloped villains, I found few noteworthy flaws and a great deal
that I truly enjoyed. Overall, I give *Ready Player One* four out of five stars.
