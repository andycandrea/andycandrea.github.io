As I mentioned yesterday, I started work on fixing my tests first thing this morning. It turns out that running tests that depend on Javascript is a little more complicated than I expected, but I got most of it sorted out by standup. I still have a few weird bugs in my tests that I haven't yet figured out, but I got caught up in my blog post today, which means I'll get to work on them tomorrow. A working draft of my post is essentially finished, so I should be able to get it fully finished tomorrow, which means the rest of my week will be working on Hacker News stretch goals and collaborating with Nathanael on a final blog post.
