First thing this morning, I submitted my pull request to the dev Campfire. I got a lot of really great feedback that I was then able to spend my afternoon looking over. I ended up having more work to do than expected to get my branch ready for merging, but I also ended up learning a lot more as well, which made it more than worth it. I'll hopefully be able to get my code approved soon so I finally deploy, which will lead me into new week right on schedule.
