This morning, I worked on getting my tests for the reset password feature of my app finished. I managed to get my mailer test, `user_mailer_spec.rb`, finished without much trouble, but my feature test, `resetting_password_spec.rb`, took ended up taking most of my free time during the afternoon, as it took a decent amount of reading on how to best test whether an email was properly sent. I ended up doing a lot of checks on `ActionMailer::Base.deliveries` to get my tests working, but I'm curious to see if anyone will suggest any alternatives in the PR I put up this afternoon. During the test-writing process, I also learned about `Object.reload` with FactoryGirl, which comes in handy if you need to test that a model's field was changed properly.

I also got to do another pairing session with Chris this afternoon, which was again incredibly helpful---the refactoring that we did on my authentication code both taught me a lot and definitely increased the readability and logicality of my code. In addition, the rest of the interns and I had a preliminary presentation on Winsome, our progress and our goals, which turned out great. Nathanael and I are hoping that it will spark some conversation among the devs about our schema, which can currently be found [here](https://docs.google.com/a/viget.com/spreadsheets/d/1g2-CPU3PZMZ0uTRD35El6SNxzRR4ZLO8lqDIPtRLnSI/edit#gid=0).
