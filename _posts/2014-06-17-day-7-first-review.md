description: I had my very first code review at Viget.
---

After pairing with Zachary yesterday and doing a little more work this morning, I was finally able to finish my Hacker News clone's first feature: the ability to post an article. As a result, I was able to submit my first pull request for review by the Viget devs. I got a lot of really great feedback that helped me learn a little more about Rails, Viget standards and some new libraries---my sincere thanks to everyone who helped out. 

After a little bit of tweaking, I managed to get my pull request approved and started work on the second feature. As of the end of the day, my app is able to show all of the most recent posts, but, since I got a little bit ahead of myself, I still have to finish writing some tests before I submit a new pull request. I'm almost finished with that as well, but have a few more edits to make on my test to ensure that the posts are properly sorted by date. Tomorrow, I should be able to finish up the second feature pretty quickly and focus on getting my app to look better than the HTML equivalent of a cave painting.
