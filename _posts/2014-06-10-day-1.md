My first day was mostly spent setting up my machine, which consisted of installing the different technologies I'll be using over the course of the summer--Ruby, Rails, etc--and getting reacquainted with OSX. I also got to learn more about Viget and started constructing this blog, which required getting myself familiar with Jekyll. In addition to Jekyll, I also used Bootstrap for the nav bar and basic layout help.
