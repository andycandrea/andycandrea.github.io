As of this afternoon, all of the dev tickets that were tagged to be finished by our final presentation have been completed! This gives Nathanael and I the opportunity to put more time into fine-tuning our portions of the Labshare for FLF, which will be really helpful (for me, at least!). It also gave me some time to start organizing my thoughts for a blog post for next week, where I hope to write about the best ways to prepare for a Rails internship. Similarly, Nathanael will be writing about how to get the most out of an internship, and we'll be collaborating on a third post that will be more about what to do after your internship is finished.
