[Winsome](http://bewinso.me) has officially been presented! This morning, Janice and I finished ironing out our portion of the presentation and got it much more fluid than it had originally been. I felt really proud with how the actual presentation went--I think the rest of the team really hit their sections out of the park. Aside from some Google Analytics code accidentally breaking out Stats page later in the day, this afternoon was pretty light in terms of intern stuff, which gave me the opportunity to work more on my blog. I still don't have an outline, but I *do* have a Gist of resources that I'm pretty happy with [here](https://gist.github.com/andycandrea/75f5e97c25934fc9eb84), which I'll link to in my post. From here, I plan to add ratings to each resource (in addition to my existing details) and build an outline before I begin to actually write the post out. Hopefully, I'll be able to knock it out pretty quickly, so I can do more work on Hacker News next week.
