title: Day 6 - Getting started with Hacker News
description: I finally started my Hacker News app.
---

Today was the first day that I got to start working on  my clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/). I had originally planned on generating a scaffold using Rails, which would essentially give me the functionality I need for this week---being able to post and view articles. With a lot of help from Zachary, however, we ended up pairing to create the article model, view and controller one-by-one. While this definitely slowed me down, it was more than worth it, as it ensured that I knew more about how to get everything to work together. It was also my first true experience with test-driven development, as Zachary wrote some tests that we then worked together to pass.

Tomorrow, I'll keep working on this week's assignment and will hopefully manage to get the basic functionality finished, which will give me the rest of the week to tweak it and learn some more Rails.
