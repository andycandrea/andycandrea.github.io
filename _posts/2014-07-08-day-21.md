After finishing up my test for the `PasswordReset` class, I got a little bit more feedback on my password reset functionality and, somewhat to my surprise, quite a bit of feedback on the pagination code I merged in a few weeks ago. After the Dev Powwow and getting that cleaned up, I had to wrestle with Heroku to figure out why my app has been down. It turns out it was mostly due to a misplaced line of code which took me way longer to track down than it should have. However, it's luckily all up and running again and updated with my latest merges into `master`.

Now that I finally have that out of the way, I can finally start on commenting. I plan to get non-threaded comments working first, which shouldn't be too bad, and then work on threading them. Here's hoping that getting the comment feature all merged in will go by more quickly than the password reset feature!
