Today marks the end of the first week I've spent at Viget. So far, I've managed to set up this blog---while learning a couple things along the way---meet a great group of people and dive a little more deeply into learning Rails, which is my primary goal for the summer. The other interns and I have also managed to create a pretty detailed and exciting plan for our summer project, which will be a social betting web app (more details to come). 

As well as being the end of my first week, today was also my very first Free Lunch Friday (FLF) at Viget, which was awesome. I got to learn a lot about what the company has been up to lately as well as get a few sneak peeks into some things that will be coming up soon. I even got to talk a little bit about one of my favorite hobbies, which is playing [the marimba](http://www.adams-music.com/pf/images/brochure2012/Adams_Marimba_Artist-Classic_MAHC55_600px.jpg).

Even with how great that FLF was, the most exciting part of my day was that, as I finished a few more Rails tutorials, I could start to envision how I'll be tying what I learn into my first project, a clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), which has got me even more pumped for the rest of my time here at Viget.

To finish up my first week of blogging, here's some proof that shredding on a marimba is [a real thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o-1-w33-o7Y).
