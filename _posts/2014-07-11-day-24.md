Today had more refactoring than I expected for my commenting, so I didn't manage to get my branch merged in until the end of the day. That said, I also managed to get a little time to read over some Twitter API stuff as well as OmniAuth, which should help get us off to a good start next week. Hopefully I can also find some time to work on the voting feature for HN.
