description: Finished with user creation--on to login/logout!
---

This morning, I managed to get my user creation finished up without much trouble---the error I was running into yesterday that prevented password confirmation from working properly was just a result of my forgetting to permit `password_confirmation` in my user parameters. As usual, I got some great feedback in my code review. This may just be optimism talking, but I like to think that the amount of effort needed to edit my code after a review has been steadily decreasing. Either way, I've been learning quite a bit, both due to the work I've been putting in and the feedback I've been getting on said work.

Most of my afternoon was spent in meetings, so I didn't get much chance to work on the login/logout system for my app like I had intended. That said, those meetings were definitely productive. For one, Nathanael and I started to work on defining a schema for our intern project with input from Helen, Alexsandra and Pat. While we didn't make quite as much progress as we would've liked, it was definitely a very useful meeting that made us think a little bit more about some of the features we had all planned to include. Hopefully, we'll be able to finish up the schema in our one-on-one tomorrow afternoon.
