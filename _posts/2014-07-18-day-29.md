Since I apparently forgot to blog yesterday, I'll throw up a quick summary of the last few days. On Wednesday, we had TTT, which was really great and incredibly interesting. Yesterday, I worked on finishing up refactoring the `bet-creation` branch with Nathanael so that he wouldn't be blocked. While waiting for more feedback and thumbs, I started working on the `bet#index`, `bet#show`, `bet#update` and `bet#edit` actions, which led into today.

First thing, I did some refactoring based on feedback from Zach and Nathanael and later helped Helen make sure that a rebase she did didn't undo any of the back end work up to that point. After a snafu with Git conflicts earlier in the day, it was pretty reassuring to see how quickly she'd managed to get `master` back up and running. For the rest of the afternoon, I finished up some refactoring on my `bet-viewing` branch and meticulously rebased both it and the `bet-creation` branch to ensure that as few merge conflicts as possible will arise. I managed to get the `bet-creation` branch merged in, and I think I'm pretty close to done with `bet-viewing`, so it should let me go into next week pretty much on schedule.
