Thanks to some great help from ZP, I was able to get my bug from yesterday fixed up first thing this morning. That said, I still got to spend a good amount of time on the same branch due to a few other great suggestions. For the most part, I ended up just moving some of my logic and methods to different files for a more organized flow, but I also managed to clean up my code a fairly good amount. This also led to a few more tests and some basic routing stuff, like making sure the URL didn't change if a database save failed and redirecting signed in and signed out users away from pages that didn't make sense for them to visit. This also led me to finish another of the week's tasks on the same branch, which was to ensure that only signed in users could post an article.

Unfortunately, that still means that I didn't manage to get to pagination, which was the last of the week's assignments. That said, I don't imagine it to be terribly difficult, so I might even be able to get another pull request up this weekend if I can merge my `user-authentication` branch before heading home tonight.
