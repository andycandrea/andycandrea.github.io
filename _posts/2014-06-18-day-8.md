I managed to finish up the rest of my work from yesterday, which allowed me to submit my [article-viewing branch](https://github.com/andycandrea/hnews/tree/article-viewing) for review by the devs. Afterwards, I did some front end work for my app to make it a little more user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing, taking design cues from both [Reddit](www.reddit.com) and the real [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

Once I finished with a basic design, I started work on requiring the URL of a new post to be properly formatted. Initially, I was just going to use Ruby's `URI::REGEXP` for matching, but I quickly learned that it didn't function exactly as I wanted. Specifically, when checking HTTP or HTTPS, it validates `http://` and `https://` while not allowing a URI without the scheme specified, meaning that something like `www.google.com` does not validate. It also allows for the port to be arbitrarily large, though I wouldn't expect that to have any kind of significant impact.

As a result, I'm editing a class that Zachary sent me to validate full URLs to ensure that the scheme doesn't have to be specified. To do so, I'm writing my own regular expression by taking advantage of [Rubular](http://rubular.com/), which has proven to be pretty handy. Tomorrow, I plan to finish up with my validator and get my app deployed to Heroku.
