I managed to get two small PRs merged in today: one to show the correct information on `bets#index` and only allow bet creators to select a winning option from those that have picks associated with them, and one to fix a related bug on `bets#index`. Bets that have passed their deadline without a winner being declared have now been moved to the `Active` category rather than the `Settled` category, which ended up being a little more complicated than expected to implement, as it required some rather tricky scoping.

Nathanael and I also had two Hangouts: one to bring each other up to speed on the code we've written since last talking, which turned out to be a really great idea---props to Nathanael for suggesting it---and another to work on the `Active` and `Settled` scopes for `Bets`. The latter Hangout was also really helpful for me, as Nathanael definitely has more experience with that kind of problem. Next week, I hope to knock out the remaining test refactors as quickly as possible and move on to QA fixes.
