After wrestling with some basic Javascript for a little while this morning, I finally got the chance to style and finish my tests for my threaded comments. From a design point of view, my site is still pretty bare, but the functionality seems to be there. I'm just waiting on some feedback and approval at the moment, but it should (hopefully) be merged in by EOD.

Tomorrow should let me get started on my up-boating :boat: functionality, which I plan to go at pretty hard so I have as little Hacker News stuff left over as we move into crunch time for Winsome. Speaking of which, we officially have a URL (nothing there yet, though), and Zach told Nathanael and I about an awesome gem ([OmniAuth Twitter](https://github.com/arunagw/omniauth-twitter)) that should streamline the development of our authentication process. Nathanael and I plan to have a Hangout for some pairing on Monday afternoon, which should get us off to a good start on the dev process.
