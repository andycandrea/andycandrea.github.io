This morning, I worked on finishing up the tests for the work that ZP and I did yesterday. While doing so, I decided to do some more work on `UserSelection#save` to get it mostly functional, which slowed me down due to some weird SQL behavior. Luckily, I managed to get it figured out, which let me get a form for adding a pick working. Unfortunately, I still haven't managed to figure out editing a pick, so I'll have to get that done tomorrow.
