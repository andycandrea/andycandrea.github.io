description: Bets are completed (kind of )!

Since I forgot to do a blog post yesterday, this post will be about the last two days. I started off the day yesterday with a great check-in with ZP, where we talked about the work I did last week on HN and Winsome. After that, I did a little bit of debugging with Helen and Nathanael over the course of the morning while I started work on allowing bet creators to specify a winning option. I managed to get that up into a PR by the end of the day, so I started off this morning by doing a little refactoring based on feedback.

After that was done, I was able to merge the branch in and do some prep for the Hacker News presentation. I decided to go through it PR by PR, which I think was a decent idea that I ended up executing in a so-so fashion---since I went through it all a little fast, I forgot to touch on some of my notes or show much code, which was a bit of a bummer. After that, I started working on sprucing up `bet#show` by tying some loose ends up in the forms, like the CarrierWave integration. I didn't manage to fully finish since Helen caught up a bug missed in the PR I merged in earlier in the day, so I worked on fixing that and ended the day by changing up the presentation of the `picks` on `bet#show` to make it easier for her to match Janice's designs. Tomorrow, I'll keep working on the CarrierWave stuff.
