description: Hacker News is almost ready for deployment!
---

After a lot of tinkering and changing my mind, I finally got my Hacker News app to the point where I feel like I'm ready to deploy version 1. I have a decent (read: not great nor horrible) design, all the functionality I needed for week one and some extra validation finished.

My work today unfortunately went much slower than I anticipated---mostly due to the fact that I changed my mind about several things several times---so I didn't manage to get the extra stuff I've done reviewed and approved. Due to the fact that the day is almost finished, I've decided to wait until tomorrow to submit my latest branch for review, but I should be able to get it officially finished early tomorrow, which means that it should be deployed to Heroku by the time the standups start.
