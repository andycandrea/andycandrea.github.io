Today marks the beginning of the last week of the internship, and the first week where I don't have a specified schedule. As a result, I got the chance to revisit my Hacker News clone and finish up voting. I managed to get my votes properly working with AJAX---rather than having dedicated routes and page loads for voting---without too much trouble, though I did hit a small snag when trying to get my Javascript properly called from my `votes_controller`. Tomorrow, I'll try to fix any tests that I broke and hopefully get a PR in, which will let me concentrate on my blog post.
