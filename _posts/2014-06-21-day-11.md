After a little snafu when migrating my database from SQLite to Postgresql---protip: install Postgres with [Postgres.app](http://postgresapp.com/) rather than Homebrew---I finally managed to get my clone of Hacker News deployed to Heroku! It can be found [here](http://haxx0r-news.herokuapp.com/)---any feedback would be welcome, either via a comment on this blog or by opening an issue on the [repo](https://github.com/andycandrea/hnews/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open).

The rest of my day was largely spent in meetings or in working on my second week of Hacker News assignments. I decided to start by making some tests for the User model and filled in my model code as I went to pass my tests (a la red-green-refactor) and happily made some pretty good progress. I managed to get a model, controller and view for creating a new user that's mostly working, but I ran into an issue where my app is allowing an empty/non-matching `password_confirmation` form, which seems to be something that should be done automatically by the `has_secure_password` method. Tomorrow, I'll keep working to figure out how to fix it, which should let me get a code review in so I can start work on some more features.
