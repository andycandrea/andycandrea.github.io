description: More refactoring!
---

Today was mostly spent finishing up what I had been working on prior to the holiday weekend, namely refactoring my password reset functionality. With Zachary's help, I managed to get the refactor working properly, which was great. Before I can merge it in, though, I still have to finish writing tests for my new `PasswordReset` class.

In addition to the Hacker News work, we also had a standup for Winsome. Connection issues during the Hangout not withstanding, it went quite well. Hopefully, in the next day or two, Nathanael and I will be able to find a time to meet and go over some of the Twitter API.
