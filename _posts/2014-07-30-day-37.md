description: Jumping all around different branches on Winsome
---
Since the main functionality of Winsome is finished, I've been working on cleaning up a lot of what we've already written and helping Helen with hooking up some of her front end work. Today, I managed to get image uploading via CarrierWave working again---though there's still a little hiccup with the image preview on `bets#new` due to EXIF issues in the browser---and getting the proper data to show up on `bets#index`.

Tomorrow, I'll work on merging in my CarrierWave stuff and other edits to `bets#show`, fixing a bunch of tests that have been broken by recent changes that the three of us have made and reorganizing most of the methods in `ApplicationController` into different concerns.
