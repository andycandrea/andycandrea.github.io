description: A comment about commenting on comments.
---

This morning, I worked on finishing up my basic, non-threaded commenting feature. I had to do a little more debugging than I expected, but managed to get most everything figured out. After lunch, Zachary and I paired on fixing my last bug and starting work on the threaded comments. Zach taught me a pretty cool trick to assign a value when dealing with polymorphism, which can be found on [this RailsCast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/154-polymorphic-association) in the `find_commentable` method. Protip (thanks to Zach): add some kind of check after the `if name =~ ...` to make sure that only a type you want to be passed can get in, i.e. something like `$1.in? %w[comment article]`. I also learned a little about `request.referer`, matching in Ruby and utilizing Javascript in a Rails app, so major thanks to ZP for dropping the knowledge---definitely one of the best pairing sessions I've had so far, which is saying something.

As of right now, I think I've got threaded comments working, which means tomorrow will be working on styling---you can't really tell a comment is a reply to another when they're all at the same indentation---and writing some tests for the threading itself, which should mean I'll be able to finally start on this week's assignment and work with Nathanael on the Twitter auth.
