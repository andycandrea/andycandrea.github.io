description: Getting better with Rails and setting the foundation for our project with the other interns.
---

Today marked the first day that I didn't make any edits to this blog---aside from posting, of course---which let me spend my time outside of meetings getting better with Rails and helping to set a foundation for our project with the other Viget interns. While I didn't make quite as much progress today with the former---my day was broken up by a couple of (very interesting) meetings which brought me out of the zone, so to speak---the rest of the interns and I made a lot of great progress towards defining our summer project. Stay tuned for more info!
