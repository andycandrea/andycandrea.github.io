Today, I kept working on my blog post and making some edits to my latest Hacker News PR. The blog has really shaped up and should be ready to post tomorrow. I'll also start working on the third post in the mini blog series that Nathanael and I are doing tomorrow with his help. Hopefully, that'll go well, and I'll get to merge in my voting branch so I can try to knock out the stretch challenges by the end of the week!
