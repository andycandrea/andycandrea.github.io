After managing to get some debugging and testing finished this morning, I managed to get my login/logout functionality working for the Hacker News app. Tomorrow, I hope to do some refactoring that Pat suggested done as early as possible so I can get this week's assignment finished on time.

In addition to my progress on Haxx0r News, I also got the chance to have a one-on-one with Nathanael to work on the database schema for Winsome. We managed to get it as finished as we can without clarifying a few functional questions with the rest of the interns, which we'll hopefully get to do in our standup tomorrow.
