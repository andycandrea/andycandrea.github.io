Whenever someone in the Triangle finds out that I was born and raised in a
relatively rural area in Wisconsin, it seems like his or her first reaction is
to think of what I must've lacked while growing up: shops within walking
distance of home, public transportation or—the real kicker—number of days in a
year where I could go outside without fear of frostbite.

What most people who are used to the luxury of walking to the grocery store
don't realize, however, are the things that Wisconsinites have in abundance
(well, except for cheese—I swear that some people down here think the reason
that Wisconsin developed a cheese named "brick" is so that we could build small
cities with it).

One memory that's stuck with me since my early days in the South occurred during
my first semester of college at Carolina. I'd gone for a walk around campus,
and, right as I was about to cross Stadium Drive near Carmichael
Hall, I realized that it truly felt like fall for the first time in nearly a
year. The air was cool and dry, the sun hung low in the afternoon sky, and I was
about to enjoy one of my favorite autumnal traditions: taking a deep breath of
fall air for the first time in months. Since fall—or, at least, the feeling of
fall—starts considerably later in the year in North Carolina than it does in
Wisconsin, this moment was long overdue.

Back in Wisconsin, the autumn air has an almost euphoric quality. The
temperature is perfect: cold enough to refresh but not cold enough to chill. The
air is almost pristinely fresh, and, as the humid summer begins to give way to a
bone-day Midwestern winter, the air becomes so crisp that it actually develops
an almost physical bite. I don't think that I really have the words to do it
justice, but take my word: it's refreshing, it tastes *wonderful*, and it's just
enough to give me a big, goofy smile whenever I get the chance to experience it.

As I was standing there on campus, I fully anticipated that exact same feeling;
after all, I'd never experienced fall outside of the Midwest. What I got,
however, was complete, utter and heartbreaking disappointment.

To give you an idea of what I experienced, imagine your favorite crispy food,
whether it be a potato chip, cracker or some kind of wafer. Now imagine that you
haven't had a chance to eat this particular treat in nearly a year, and, rather
unexpectedly, you come to realize you happen to have a nearly inexhaustible
supply within grasp. You grab the first one, you go to take a bite...

...And you find that your usually crispy delight feels like it's been soaked in
tepid, stagnant water for an hour. It's not just that it tastes bad—it's that
it *feels* entirely ***wrong***. Instead of that satisfying *crunch* you were so
eagerly awaiting, you get mush.

Seriously, imagine a mushy, lukewarm potato chip. It's disgusting, and it's
exactly how the air felt and tasted in that moment.

Gross.

I really don't expect to live there again, but I could never choose to skip out
on being a born and bred Wisconsinite. While, sure, it would've been nice to
have less than eight months of winter growing up, and, yeah, the difficulty of
developing plans with your friends who lived forty-five minutes away from each
other was a bit of a pain, there are a bunch of things about growing up in
Wisconsin that I could never give up—especially those deep breaths of autumn
air.
