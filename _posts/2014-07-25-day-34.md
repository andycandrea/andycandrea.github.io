Since a lot of people were out of the office today, it took a longer than usual to get the necessary feedback and :+1:s to merge in my PR for selecting picks in Winsome. Since the last real betting feature is closing a bet and selecting the winner---which is partially dependent upon having the `pick-selection` branch merged in---I decided to work on the Hacker News clone while waiting.

I actually managed to get voting completely functional with just a couple hours of time. That said, it doesn't work exactly as most people would expect. Rather than some kind of radio-button-esque identifier that creates a vote on click and gets styled to identify the vote is active without a page load, my method works currently has a `redirect_to`, meaning there's a page load after clicking. Hopefully, I can write a little bit of Javascript to take out the redirect, though I think I'll still be relying more on Rails than JS than I originally expected. While there's no PR for it yet, the working code can be found on my `voting` branch [here](https://github.com/andycandrea/hnews/tree/voting). Also, as a result of finishing up the integration spec for voting, I managed to surpass a hundred tests on my HN clone, which is something I find pretty cool.
