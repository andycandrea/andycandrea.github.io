# My Vigeblog

This repository contains the source files for my Jekyll blog found [here](andycandrea.github.io). The blog currently supports comments via [Disqus](disqus.com) and has an RSS feed [here](andycandrea.github.io/feed.xml). Over the course of the summer, I plan to add:

* Post categorization
* A sitemap
* Post excerpts on the main page

I'll also be tweaking the layout to make it more mobile-friendly.
