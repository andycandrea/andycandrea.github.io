# My Vigeblog

This repository contains the source files for my Jekyll blog found [here](andycandrea.github.io). The blog currently supports comments via [Disqus](disqus.com) and has an RSS feed [here](andycandrea.github.io/feed.xml). Over the course of the summer, I plan to add:

* Post categorization
* ~~A sitemap~~ Added in [this commit](https://github.com/andycandrea/andycandrea.github.io/commit/e3a90b9750d011f8eb07565ddea0bc7388cfb8d5)
* Post excerpts on the main page

I'll also be tweaking the layout to make it more mobile-friendly.
