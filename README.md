This repo contains the source code for my personal website and Jekyll blog that
can be found at [andycandrea.github.io](andycandrea.github.io). The theme is
based on [end2end](https://github.com/nandomoreirame/end2end) by [Fernando
Moreira](https://github.com/nandomoreirame).

The original version of this site containing the blog posts I wrote for my
internship at [Viget](viget.com) is archived on the `internship-blog` branch.
